Day 1(Python basics)

.Three important parts in python

output
static-input will not change
dynamic input will be given by the user.
.conditional statements
if 
if else
Elif
nested if
.conditional loops
for
while
break
continue
pass
.traversing-visiting each and every input
in numbers, we can only use a while loop
while- we do not know how many iterations to know the condition
n=1234
while n>10:
rem=n%10
print(rem)
string-immutable
list-mutable
