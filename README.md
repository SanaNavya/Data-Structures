# Data-Structures

Day 1(Python basics)

.Three important parts in python
input
algorithm
output
static-input will not change
dynamic input will be given by the user.
.conditional statements
if 
if else
Elif
nested if
.conditional loops
for
while
break
continue
pass
.traversing-visiting each and every input
in numbers, we can only use a while loop
while- we do not know how many iterations to know the condition
n=1234
while n>10:
rem=n%10
print(rem)
string-immutable
list-mutable


Day -2

primitive data type int, string, boolean
non-primitive-list, set, tuple, dictionary
user-defined- 
class is a user-defined data type.
attributes-features
behavior- functions
constructor-it is a method called or named by init, a constructor is an object 
self-object being passed in the instance

data structure-user defined data type which makes code easy
stack- lifo  we can implement stack without using class
expressions-collection of operands and operations
